Just a small project for weekend.  Goal will be to get something up on a vanilla Ubuntu, which I understand has been done already by a German citizen.  Yay!  So work approach will be to rip out the Android dependencies and try to get this thing working independently of any assumptions made that there is an Android-flavored Linux underneath.  There won't be.  So we need to get through that.  I understand a bit of the problem around just compiling, resolving missing dependencies, and then see if there are bionic issues, since there are no plans to port over bionic.  Then we can see what the effort is on the harmony libraries.  And on top of this, we need to see about these zygotes and other notions of memory management which may be specific to the little Android.  The target will be x86 for now.  Arm9 or something similar will be a target after there is something even doing a hello world.
