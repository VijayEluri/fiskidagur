The Declaration of Independent Devices
======================================

The Base platform for IoT explorations, "Fiskidagur" founded on the principle that 
all devices are created equal, that no device, no matter how small, shall endure 
disconnected-ness or inability to talk to its neighbor simply on basis of OS, 
language, or other arbitrary attribute of a platform.  We hearby decree that 
the Internet Of Things is made up of devices large or small, and that they 
shall be aware of their surroundings, and not subject to hostile violation of 
a device's right to privacy, to communicate, to hibernate, or otherwise 
perform work on behalf of it's owner or federation identity group.  And they are not
limited to IDC's vision of the future, but may exceed our own wildest dreams.


The first version of this project is/was An Android "free" version of Dalvik 
for the desktop or embeeded, with a free toolchain allowing Dalvik to go all 
the way to Fiskidagur if need be.  Otherwise, we can settle for Ubuntu :p .

This directory contains the Dalvik virtual machine and associated
class library.

A note about the licenses and header comments
---------------------------------------------

Much of the code under this directory originally came from the Apache
Harmony project, and as such contains the standard Apache header
comment. Some of the code was written originally for the Android
project, and as such contains the standard Android header comment.
Some files contain code from both projects. In these cases, the header
comment is a combination of the other two, and the portions of the
code from Harmony are identified as indicated in the comment.

Here is the combined header comment:
